# Introduction

Hello, Hello, Hi!

I have started learning JavaScript using the freeCodeCamp's [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8) course. While learning, this was the very first project of building a Role Playing Game. I tweaked some of the elements of it, and I have plans to add more features in future as I learn more.

# Game Features

The game has the following interesting features:
- Different weapons with different hit levels (means more powerful weapon will damage opponent's health more)
- Weapon selling option (only during a certain Gold Count)
- Randomly generated scenarios when the player will have his weapon broken or his attack dodged by the opponent
- The hit level will increase as the player's XP increases.
- Distinct XP and Gold Rewards for each "Practice Ankon Defeat" or win against each Cave's Ankon.
- **Easter Egg** to buy free golds by playing a Guessing Game with the opponent. This feature is hidden inside the game.

Have fun playing the game! If you want to build this game, head to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), finish the [Responsive Website Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) and start JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (Beta).
